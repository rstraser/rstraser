### 👋 Hello, I'm [Rob Straser](https://www.google.com)!

In short, I'm a bug nerd that uses data to better inform decision makers. I apply laboratory techniques, field observations, and data science to gain novel insight to problems that affect crops, organisms, and the environment.

I use programming to address whatever problems may come my way, conducting analyses on topics that interest me ✨.
