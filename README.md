### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD candidate interested in agroecology and sustainable food systems. I apply laboratory techniques, field observations, and data science to gain novel insight to problems that affect crops, organisms, and the environment. My goal is to promote happier, healthier communities.
